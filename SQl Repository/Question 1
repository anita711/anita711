Q: A problem where we need to identify cities where covid cases **increasing everyday. We will use SQL analytic window RANK function to solve the problem.

Schema: City(VARCHAR), Days(DATE), Cases(INT)

Define Problem: City Names, where case INCREASING(order by cases asc), EVERYDAY(DATE ORDER BY ASC)

with CTE as(Select CITY, 
rank() over(partition by CITY order by DAYS ASC) as rnD,
RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY CITY ORDER BY CASES ASC) AS rnc,
rank() over(partition by CITY order by DAYS ASC) - RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY CITY ORDER BY CASES ASC) as rank_diff
from table
)

select CITY
from CTE
group by city
having count(distinct rank_diff) = 1 and avg(rank_diff) = 0

ANOTHER APPROACH - 

with cte as (SELECT *,
CASES - LAG(CASES,1, 0) OVER(PARTITION BY CITY ORDER BY DAYS) AS lag_value // here lag would give zero for first row instead NULL return
from table
)
select DISTINCT city from cte 
where city NOT IN(
            Select city FROM CTE where lag_value <= 0);
